# 📧 Email Spam Detection System

A full-stack Machine Learning web application that classifies email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a trained **Scikit-learn** model.

The application combines a **React.js frontend**, **Flask backend**, and a Machine Learning model to provide fast and accurate spam detection.

# ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an email message.
2. React sends the email text to the Flask backend.
3. The backend preprocesses the text using NLP techniques.
4. TF-IDF Vectorizer converts the text into numerical features.
5. The trained Machine Learning model predicts whether the email is Spam or Not Spam.
6. The prediction is displayed instantly on the screen.
