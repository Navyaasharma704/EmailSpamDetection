# 📧 Email Spam Detection System

## 📖 Overview

The Email Spam Detection System is a Machine Learning web application that predicts whether an email message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

The user enters an email message into the application, and the trained Machine Learning model analyzes the text and displays the prediction instantly.

This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to frontend-backend integration.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an email message.
2. React sends the message to the Flask backend.
3. Flask preprocesses the text.
4. The trained Machine Learning model predicts whether the email is Spam or Not Spam.
5. The prediction is displayed on the screen.
